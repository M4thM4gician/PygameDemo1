# Pygame Demonstration 1

## Introduction
This is an introductory project for learning how to use the Python pygame module.  The demonstration here was created by following the tutorials and image/audio files provided by TechWithTim (Big thanks to TechWithTim for providing learning materials and supporting files for this introductory demo!!).  This is not a "playable" game as there is no goal and no way to win or lose.  This project was simply to understand the basics of using pygame, including:
- creating a window
- drawing on the window
- creating a background
- interpreting keystroke events
- creating/animating a character
- managing multiple character objects
- object collision
- adding sound effects and music
